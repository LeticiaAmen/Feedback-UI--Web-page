Project Title: Feedback UI

Description
This project is a simple web application designed to collect feedback from users. It was developed following a tutorial from the YouTube channel "JavaScript King," allowing me to learn and apply key web development concepts. Users can select a rating and submit it, after which a thank you message and the provided feedback are displayed.

* HTML
* CSS
* javaScript

 Features

 * Immediate visual feedback on rating selection
 * Personalized thank you message based on the provided rating.

How to use

I would like to thank JavaScript King for the excellent tutorial that guided me in developing this project.
